# IotSensorToCloud

This is a project to move sensor data from IoT devices to an azure cloud environment. From there, the data will be cleaned and put into proper pipelines. 
The Azure Cloud environment will eventually be linked to a local server to achieve a hybrid cloud model. 
At some point, I would like to have the data put into a visualization software, such as splunk, tableau, or some other equivalent.
